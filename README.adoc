= Testing Antora assembler for PDF builds

This is for investigating https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-assembler/[Antora assembler]
to produce PDFs in an Antora-native way, rather than our current hacks.

== Background

For details, refer to the 
https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-assembler/-/blob/main/README.adoc[Antora assembler README].

== Install dependencies

[source,zsh]
----
npm install
bundle config --local path .bundle/gems && bundle
----

== Build

[source,zsh]
----
npx antora playbook.yml
----

The output mentions the HTML, but not the PDF.

Browse the HTML starting at `./build/site/index.html`.

The PDF is generated in `build/assembler/example/example-docs.pdf`.
The build copies to the file to `build/site/example/example-docs.pdf`.
