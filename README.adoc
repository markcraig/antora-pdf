= Sample project to reproduce PDF generation issues

This is for investigating the https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-assembler/-/blob/main/README.adoc[Antora Assembler]
to produce PDFs in an Antora-native way, rather than our current hacks.

It aims to reproduce problems encountered when generating PDFs that aren't seen when generating HTML.

== Before you start

Follow the instructions in the 
https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-assembler/-/blob/main/README.adoc[Antora Assembler README]
to install the software you need for the builds.

Notice that this repo already provides the `Gemfile`, `antora-assembler.yml`, and `pdf-theme.yml` files.

== Build HTML

[source,zsh]
----
npx antora site.yml**

== Build PDF

[source,zsh]
----
npx antora site-pdf.yml
